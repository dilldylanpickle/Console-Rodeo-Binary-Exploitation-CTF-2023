# Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-CTF-2023
Welcome to the Console Rodeo Binary Exploitation Workshop! Binary exploitation is the process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in software programs.

## Step 0: Let's learn about the Linux environment :)
First, let's get to learn about the first challenge!

1. Use the `cd` command to change your directory to the `/challenge0` directory. You can use the `ls` command to see the contents provided.

***Terminal:***
```bash
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023$ cd challenge0/
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023/challenge0$ ls
challenge0  challenge0.c
```

2. Use the `file` command to identify the type of computer file.

***Terminal:***
```bash
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023/challenge0$ file challenge0
challenge0: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=3080865b14741219087b3ccf7ebb8df4e2b28a1a, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped
```

The file called `challenge0` is a Linux ELF 64-bit executable. The various information displayed is out of this workshops scope so don't worry about it for now :)

3. In order to run our `challenge0` computer program, we must grant us permission! Use the `chmod` command on the `challenge0` file.

***Terminal:***
```bash
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023/challenge0$ ls -al | grep challenge0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 dilldylanpickle dilldylanpickle 17592 Oct 27 21:57 challenge0
-rw-r--r-- 1 dilldylanpickle dilldylanpickle   574 Oct 16 20:11 challenge0.c
```

> The `grep` command allows us to filter out extra information. In this case, we only listed the `challenge0` information! 

4. Run the `challenge0` by using the `./` symbols. Now, we can see what this program is doing!

***Terminal:***
```bash
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023/challenge0$ ./challenge0 
How many characters does it take to crash :)
```

5. The `challenge0` program is asking for a user input. Let's enter the word `Console Cowboys` to see what happens next!

***Terminal***
```bash
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023/challenge0$ ./challenge0 
How many characters does it take to crash :)
Console Cowboys

Try again next time :(
```

6. This program needed a larger input of characters. Let's see of we can crash the program!

***Terminal***
```bash
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023/challenge0$ ./challenge0 
How many characters does it take to crash :)
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii                                         
Congratulations! You win!
Segmentation fault
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023/challenge0$
```

We were able to crash the program! When we see `segmentation fault`, it means our program crashed due to something weird...hmm?

## Step 2: Learn about C programming!

We should probably figure out why our program crashed when we spammed a bunch of `i` characters. Let's look at the original code of the program. You'll notice another file called `challenge.c`. We can use the `file` command on `challenge0.c`.

***Terminal***
```bash
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023/challenge0$ file challenge0.c
challenge0.c: C source, ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators
```

We can see this is a C source code file. Let's look at the file an see what's going on.

1. Use the `cat` command to read through the `challenge0.c` program.

***Terminal***
```c
dilldylanpickle@linux:~/Console-Rodeo-Binary-Exploitation-Workshop-2023/challenge0$ cat challenge0.c 
/* this basically imports a "library" and will allow our program to do cool stuff
like display text and take user input! */
#include <stdio.h>

/* this mini-part of the program tells the user they inputted the correct number
of letters to win! */
void win(void) {
    printf("Congratulations! You win!\n");
}

/* this mini-part of the program tells the user they didn't input enough enough
letters to crash the program! */
void fail(void) {
    printf("\nTry again next time :(\n");
}

/* this mini-part of the program is the logic behind taking what the user gives
to the program! */
void overflow(void) {

    int overflow = 0;

    char buffer[32];

    printf("How many characters does it take to crash :)\n");

    gets(buffer);

    if (overflow > 0) {
        win();
    } else {
        fail();
    }
}

/* This is the main mini-part of the program because it runs the first mini-part! */
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    overflow();
}
``` 
Explanation: This is the main purpose of our little game. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* We create a small storage space, named "buffer", to store up to 32 characters that a user might type.

* We display a question to the user: "How many characters does it take to crash :)".

* We wait and take whatever the user types in and store it in "buffer".

* If we somehow receive more than the storage space (buffer) can hold, the memory (in this case, our "overflow" variable) might get affected.

* We check: If "overflow" is more than 0 (meaning it got affected due to an overflow), we use the "win" instruction. If not, we use the "fail" instruction.
